# CMSI 186 Lab 5 Pod Racing Starter Code

In this program, I have created a fun racing simulation that allows for the user to enter in their pods based on the types of pods I provide for the user to choose between. The user can also edit the parameters of the race itself, able to edit the time limit and the amount of slices to determine how accurate the calculations should be made in determining the winners of the race. The race allows for more than one winner (ties) and will have no winners if nothing is entered in. If the user enters a pod that does not actually move forward, it will not win the race.
